# A Supervised Math Server - A Minimal Supervisor with Connected Clients
This supervisor extends the minimal supervisor capability. If the module of a child is not available, the supervisor tries to start the child a maximum 5 times per minute. In addition, the supervisor handles two types of children. Transient and permanenet. If a child is transient and it terminate normally, then the supervisor does not restart the child. The supervisor restarts a transient child only if the child terminates abnormally. In addition, this extendend suopervisor is capable to start and stop a child given a child spec. Functions ´start_child/1´ starts a child and returns a child unique Id. Function ´stop_child/1´ stops a child given a child To make sure the message received from Math Server, the client sends a reference with the request which in return Math Server will send back with the response..
