## Asynchronous Client API against Math Server - Registered Server

With this example, we show how the Server's Pid is hidden from the client. Once the server is started, then it is registered. This is how the Client API now does not require from the end-user to pass the server's Pid. This is naturally the correct way, of course. In examples 'elementary' and 'intermediate', we did not do that for two reasons. First, we want to feel the processes in runtime. To understand the scope of the process in the source code. There are two running processes. Plus, a temporal process for the asynchronous call with API 'async_sum_areas'. With that we learn how do send messages to a process using ´!´. And also, we learn how do a process receives and evaluates messages in its mailbox queue. The second reason, we want to limit the problem in a way that for early coding sessions we tackle small steps.
